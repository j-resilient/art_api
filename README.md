# Art API Project
The first project from Open App Academy's Ruby on Rail's course, from the section on routes and controllers.  
Built on top of the code from the first homework (a very simple user api meant to get
us comfortable with routes, controllers, and using postman).  
This API allows users to store, share, and comment on artwork (urls) as well as search for other users.
